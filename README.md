# Cyber Patriots Resources
this repo is a collection of scripts, checklists, and config files to assist in the cyber patriots competion. The scripts are forked off of [Ethan Fowler's repo]() but most of the features of that script were outdated. Most of it is written in bash and batch although I expirented with python but abandoned it due to python not always being installed on the machines. I went in and updated then and added some features. These script would usually cover half of the points for the competion. The checklists are the same vulnrablilitys as the scripts cover.

This project taught me alot about writing scripts and vulnrabilities in operating systems that come from misconfiguration.
